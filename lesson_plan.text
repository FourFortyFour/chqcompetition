1. Lesson title: The Water Cycle
2. Subject: Science
3. Grade: 4th to 6th grade
4. Duration: 45 to 60 minutes
5. Key Vocabulary: Evaporation, Condensation, Precipitation, Transpiration, Water Vapor, Groundwater, Runoff
6. Least options: Live Worksheets, Smart Board, Video.
-----------------------------------------LOs-----------------------------------------
What we want students to know about:
- Different stages of the water cycle: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection
- How energy from the sun drives the water cycle

We want students to become proficient in:
- Identifying examples of the water cycle in real-life situations
- Describing the relationship between temperature, humidity, and the water cycle

We want students to understand the concepts of:
- Water conservation and the impact of human behavior on the water cycle
- How the water cycle connects to Earth's ecosystems and weather patterns.
-----------------------------------------Differentiation-----------------------------------------
How will you modify the task for students needing additional support?
- Provide visual aids such as diagrams or pictures to help explain the water cycle.
- Use simpler vocabulary and explain any complex terms used in the lesson.

How will you extend the task for students needing additional challenge?
- Have students research and present on a specific aspect of the water cycle.
- Discuss how the water cycle is affected by environmental factors such as climate change or pollution.
-----------------------------------------Prepare-----------------------------------------
- The water cycle is a process that describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of Earth. It involves the evaporation of water, the formation of clouds, precipitation, and the return of that water to Earth in the form of precipitation.

General Questions:
- What is the water cycle?
- How does the water cycle work?
- Why is the water cycle important?

Everyday Things:
- How does the water cycle affect the weather?
- How does the water cycle impact agriculture?
- What are some human activities that can impact the water cycle?
-----------------------------------------Plan-----------------------------------------
Great, here are 4 activities your students can undertake to learn about the water cycle:

1. Create a water cycle diagram:
- Provide each student with a blank sheet of paper.
- Ask them to draw a diagram of the water cycle, including labels for each stage.
- Encourage them to use blue and gray colored pencils to represent water and clouds, respectively.

2. Role-play the water cycle:
- Form groups of 4-5 students.
- Assign each group a role in the water cycle (e.g., sun, ocean, lake, plant, rain cloud).
- Ask them to act out the water cycle, starting with the sun evaporating water from the ocean and ending with precipitation.
- Encourage the students to use props such as umbrellas, spray bottles, and plastic cups.

3. Conduct a water cycle experiment:
- Provide each student with a plastic cup, plastic wrap, and a rubber band.
- Ask them to add water to the cup and cover it with the plastic wrap.
- Secure the plastic wrap with the rubber band and put the cup in direct sunlight.
- Ask students to observe the process over a day or two and have them record their observations.

4. Make a water cycle bracelet:
- Provide each student with a long piece of string and various colored beads.
- Ask them to thread the beads in a pattern that represents the water cycle.
- For example, black beads can represent evaporation, blue beads can represent condensation, and white beads can represent precipitation.
- When they are finished, they can wear the bracelet as a reminder of the water cycle process.
-----------------------------------------Apply-----------------------------------------
- Have students draw and label a diagram of the water cycle, including all relevant vocabulary (evaporation, precipitation, condensation, etc.).
- Create a "water cycle" game where students act out different stages of the cycle (e.g. one student is a droplet of water that has evaporated, another student is a cloud that has formed, etc.).
-----------------------------------------Connect-----------------------------------------
1. How does the water cycle impact the availability of water in my community?
2. In what ways can the water cycle affect agriculture and food production?
3. How does the water cycle play a role in the global climate?
4. Can human activities disrupt the water cycle? How?

Creative homework activity: Encourage students to create a visual representation of the water cycle, including annotations that explain the different stages. They can also write a short paragraph explaining how understanding the water cycle can help them make environmentally conscious decisions in their daily lives.
-----------------------------------------Evaluate-----------------------------------------
Here's a quick reflective activity for your students:

1. Ask the students to take a few minutes to think about what they learned about the water cycle in class. They can jot down notes if they want to.

2. Have them identify at least one skill they used during the lesson. Examples could include: note-taking, drawing diagrams, or participating in group discussions.

3. Ask the students to identify the most important point they learned about the water cycle. They should try to distill their learning down to just one or two key concepts.

4. Have the students think about what else they would like to know about the water cycle, or related topics. They could write down a question they still have, or a topic they would like to explore further.

5. Next, ask the students to think about how well they organized their learning during the lesson. Did they take good notes? Did they participate in group discussions? Did they ask questions when they were confused?

6. Finally, ask the students to reflect on how they could improve their learning next time. They might consider things like taking clearer notes, asking more questions, or doing more background research on the topic before class.
