--------------------differentiation--------------------
['- Provide extra visual aids to aid in comprehension', '- Break down the task into smaller, more manageable steps for them to follow']
--------------------additional--------------------
['- Provide opportunities for them to conduct experiments to observe chemical reactions first-hand', '- Encourage more open-ended exploration of the topic, allowing them to delve deeper into the scientific principles behind chemical reactions']
--------------------prepare--------------------
- Chemical reactions involve the breaking and forming of chemical bonds between atoms and molecules, resulting in the formation of new substances. (A picture of a simple chemical reaction such as the reaction between baking soda and vinegar can be included)
 
- What is a chemical reaction?
- Can you give an example of a chemical reaction?
- How are chemical reactions different from physical changes? 

- Did you know that chemical reactions are happening all around us, every day? For example, the process of rusting is a chemical reaction that occurs when iron reacts with oxygen in the presence of water to form iron oxide.
--------------------investigate--------------------
For Activity No: 1
1. What causes the reaction between baking soda and vinegar?
2. Are there any other materials that could be substituted for baking soda or vinegar in this experiment?

For Activity No: 2
1. What is the function of the dish soap in this experiment?
2. How would the reaction change if the amount of yeast or hydrogen peroxide was altered?
--------------------apply--------------------
1. Conduct simple experiments to visually demonstrate chemical reactions, such as mixing baking soda and vinegar or combining iron and sulfur to form iron sulfide.

2. Have students research and present on the various types of chemical reactions. They can demonstrate this knowledge by creating a poster or infographic.

3. Assign a lab to students in which they must identify unknown substances by conducting chemical reactions and observing the resulting changes.

4. Have students write a story or create a skit that involves chemical reactions. This can help them apply their knowledge of the topic in a fun and creative way.

5. Conduct a class discussion on the real-world applications of chemical reactions in industries such as medicine or agriculture. Have students research and present on a specific application and how it relates to the chemical reactions they've learned about.

6. Introduce a virtual lab experience in which students are able to simulate the reactions they've learned by using a software or an app.

7. Assign a project where students must design a unique chemical reaction demonstration to present to their peers.

Educator reflection:
- Was the content taught at the appropriate level for the students?
- Did any issues arise during the lesson?
- Was the pacing appropriate for the students?
- Were there enough opportunities for differentiation for students with different learning needs?
--------------------evaluate--------------------
1. How do chemical reactions impact our daily lives?
2. What are some examples of chemical reactions in our environment?
3. How do chemical reactions contribute to the growth and development of our country's industries?
4. How can we apply our knowledge of chemical reactions in our everyday activities?

Homework Activity: 
Students can create a collage or presentation showing examples of chemical reactions they encounter in their daily lives and explain the impact of those reactions. They can also conduct a simple experiment at home to observe a chemical reaction and present their findings to the class.
--------------------assessment--------------------
For a reflective activity, you can ask students to write a brief paragraph or two that answers the following questions:

1. What did you learn about chemical reactions in this class?
2. What skills did you use in the activities we did in class? (e.g. observation, measurement, data analysis, etc.)
3. What were the most important points you learned about chemical reactions?
4. What else would you like to learn about this topic or related topics in the future?
5. How well did you organize your learning in class? Did you take good notes, participate in discussions, complete assignments on time, etc.?
6. How could you improve your learning and understanding of chemical reactions next time? (e.g. study more, ask more questions, participate more in class, etc.)
--------------------reflect--------------------
- Multiple-choice quiz about identifying different types of chemical reactions
- Predicting products of a given chemical reaction
- Balancing chemical equations
- A lab experiment where students observe and record a chemical reaction
- Short answer questions about the factors that affect reaction rates and how to control them
- Peer review rubric for group projects where students create their own chemical reaction demonstrations or experiments
